<p>In using our websites and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the Terms &amp; Conditions of Service set out below (including the privacy statement).</p>
<p>These pages, the content and infrastructure of these pages, and the online accommodation reservation service provided on these pages and through the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites (the &ldquo;service&rdquo;) are owned, operated and provided by Jetstream, Ltd company (&ldquo;Jetstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and are provided for your personal use only, subject to the terms and conditions set out below.</p>
<p>Your use of the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites and these terms are also governed by the Website Terms of Use, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<h5>ABOUT US</h5>
<p>Through our websites we (Jetstream) provide an online service through which all types of temporary accommodation providers (for example, hoteliers, property managers and private owners) can advertise their properties for reservation, and through which visitors to the website can make such reservations. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the accommodation provider, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant accommodation provider and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the accommodation provider.</p>
<p>We use all reasonable skill and care to ensure that all information is accurate, complete and correct. We cannot guarantee or be held responsible for any errors, any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Our website should not be regarded as an endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating of any accommodation made available.</p>
<p>Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to use, copy, monitor, sell, display, download or reproduce any content or information available on our website for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.</p>
<h5>General</h5>
<p>These Terms &amp; Conditions of Service have been executed and delivered by you and constitute a valid and binding agreement between you and Jetstream, enforceable against you in accordance with their terms. You represent that you are (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) of legal age to form a binding contract, and (3) not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of Canada or other applicable jurisdiction.</p>
<p>You shall purchase and use the products and services available through the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites, in strict compliance with these Terms &amp; Conditions of Service and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<h5>Accommodation Rules and Restrictions</h5>
<p>By purchasing products and services through @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) you agree to abide by such additional rules and restrictions, such as the payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the rules and restrictions regarding availability, minimum age, maximum occupancy, pet policies, child policies and use of products or services. You agree that any violation of any such rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your booking, in being denied access to the applicable accommodation, in forfeiting any payments made for such reservation, and in being charged by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.</p>
<p>You may not sell, auction, barter or transfer a booking to a third party without prior written consent from @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName). @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to withhold such consent, and consent will not be given if the third party does not meet these terms and conditions.</p>
<h5>Order Processing</h5>
<p>@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) may, in its sole discretion, choose not to process or to cancel your reservation in certain circumstances. This may occur, for example, when the booking you wish to reserve is no longer available or has been mispriced, we suspect the reservation request is fraudulent, or in other circumstances @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) deems appropriate in its sole discretion. @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation.&nbsp; @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) will either not charge you or refund any charges for reservations that we do not process or cancel.</p>
<p>The Reservation Summary which you may choose to submit on our website is not a booking confirmation. The accommodation will be booked for the dates set forth in the Reservation Summary subject to acceptance by the accommodation provider, at their sole discretion, and no binding contract is in place until such time as the Booking Confirmation has been sent to you by email.</p>
<h5>Product Service Availability</h5>
<p>In rare cases a property may be available when a guest receives a Booking Confirmation, but becomes unavailable prior to check-in. If this should occur, your sole remedy shall be to contact @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) shall have no responsibility or liability as a result of a cancellation of a booking.</p>
<h5>Product and Service Descriptions</h5>
<p>Jetstream attempts to provide accurate descriptions of products and services on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites. Certain products and services available on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) Websites may be designated &ldquo;Jetstream Verified&rdquo;. Jetstream does not warrant, however, that the descriptions are current or error-free.</p>
<h5>Special Requests</h5>
<p>If you have any special requests in connection with your booking, we will happily pass along any requests we deem reasonable to the relevant accommodation providers. We cannot guarantee, however, that the accommodation providers will fulfill such requests, as such services or amenities may not be available. @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) is not liable for any failure to fulfill a special request, and no cancellation due to any special request not being met shall be allowed. @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) does not accept reservation requests or bookings conditioned or contingent on the fulfillment of a special request.</p>
<h5 id="Pricing-Information">Pricing Information</h5>
<p>Jetstream pre-negotiates certain rates with accommodation providers to facilitate the booking on your behalf. Jetstream retains service fees as compensation for facilitating bookings, which vary according to the amount and type of accommodation booked through us. The rates displayed on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites reflect our pre-negotiated rates, which include the fees retained by Jetstream.</p>
<p>@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName)&rsquo;s currency converter is for displaying estimated amounts only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual rates may vary.</p>
<p>Jetstream strives to provide accurate pricing information regarding the accommodation available on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites. We cannot, however, insure against pricing errors or pricing changes. Jetstream reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to not process or cancel any bookings placed for accommodation whose price was (1) incorrectly provided as a result of an error, or (2) changed by the accommodation provider. If this occurs, @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) will notify you by email and correct the pricing on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites.</p>
<p>If additional charges apply to your booking (including but not limited to the addition of an extra occupant, pet fees or other taxes or incidentals), and which charges you do not pay at the time of checkout on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) websites, you will be responsible for paying these charges to Jetstream or directly to the accommodation provider.</p>
<h5>Best Price Guaranteed</h5>
<p>We guarantee that you are getting the lowest possible price at the time of booking. If you find the same accommodation being offered on another website at a lower rate, contact our destination experts without delay. We will match the rate of the other deal if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul role="list">
    <li>You have contacted us immediately after booking with all the details of the other deal including a link to the offer on the other website and the exact price being quoted</li>
    <li>The other deal is bookable online and is still available when we check</li>
    <li>The other deal is subject to the same booking conditions as per your booking with Leavetown e.g. It is the same resort property, same accommodation type, same check-in and check-out dates, and identical booking terms and conditions</li>
    <li>The other deal does not include any special membership rates, loyalty points or rates, any rewards program or promotion available through the accommodation provider</li>
    <li>If we cannot match the rate of the other deal because one of the above conditions is different, we will still honor your existing booking.</li>
    <li>Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Accommodation Reservations</h5>
<p>You acknowledge that Jestream pre-negotiates rates with accommodation providers to facilitate the booking of reservations on your behalf. The rates displayed on the website are a combination of the pre-negotiated rate for accommodation reserved on your behalf by Jetstream and the facilitation fee retained by Jetstream for our services. You authorize Jetstream to book accommodation for the total displayed price, which includes the accommodation rate displayed on the website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the Jetstream services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by Jetstream for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize Jetstream to facilitate accommodation bookings on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with accommodation providers.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, Jetstream does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax charges are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc) that Jetstream pays the accommodation provider for taxes due on the accommodation provider&rsquo;s rate for the property. The accommodation providers invoice Jetstream for tax amounts. The accommodation providers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by Jetstream to the accommodation providers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the property by our guests. Service fees retained by Jetstream for our services vary based on the amount and type of accommodation booked.</p>
<h5>Modifications</h5>
<p>If you need to modify your booking (e.g. change accommodation selected, arrival or departure dates, or number of occupants), you must provide @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) with notice in writing, in advance of your arrival date, stating the modification you wish to make, then any such modification will be accepted subject to availability of accommodation as per your request. The notice period required for a modification request is specific to each property, it is determined by the accommodation provider and is detailed on the Policies page of the Property Listing.</p>
<p>@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) will not charge you any service fees to facilitate your modification request but if your modification results in additional charges from the accommodation provider (including but not limited to a change in the nightly rate due to a new arrival or departure date, the addition of an extra occupant, pet fees or other taxes or incidentals), and which charges you have not paid at the time of checkout on the @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) website, you will be responsible for paying these additional charges. To the extent any credit or refund is due, such amount will be refunded to you in the original form of payment. If this is not possible due to a credit card provider error or failure, suitable alternative options for the form of the refund will be provided promptly. All refunds will be paid in the currency in which you originally paid for the booking, as specified by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName).</p>
<h5>Cancellations</h5>
<p>If you need to cancel your booking, you must provide @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) with notice in writing of your wish to cancel. The notice period required for cancellation is specific to each property, it is determined by the accommodation provider and is detailed on the Policies page of the Property Listing. To the extent any refund is available, such amount will be refunded to you in the original form of payment. All refunds will be paid in the currency in which you originally paid for the booking, as specified by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName), and we cannot be held responsible for any changes due to currency fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>No show:</strong></p>
<p>If you do not check-in on the arrival date as specified in your Booking Summary, and you do not provide @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) with written notice of your late arrival or cancellation by no later than the date of the first night of your reservation, then @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) will cancel your booking and all monies paid will be forfeit.</p>
<h5>Taxes and Fees</h5>
<p>The sales or other taxes charged in connection with your booking depend on the location of your vacation and the accommodation provided. You will be able to view the taxes and any fees included in the Reservation Summary before submitting your reservation request.</p>
<h5>Incidentals</h5>
<p>@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) bookings do not include any incidental charges, expenses or services, except as specifically described in your booking confirmation. You are liable for any such incidental charges, expenses or services that you incur or consume during your trip.</p>
<h5>Damage Deposit</h5>
<p>At check-in the accommodation provider may make a pre-authorization on your credit card, to act as a deposit against any damage or additional cleaning required as a result of your stay in the accommodation. The pre-authorization is set by the accommodation provider of the accommodation you have. The actual cost of repair and cleaning to return the property to the original standard of the accommodation on your arrival will be made against the credit card that the accommodation provider has used for the damage deposit pre-authorization. Should the actual cost of any such repair be in excess of the pre-authorized amount the accommodation provider will charge the actual amount, not the pre-authorized amount, to the credit card. Should the accommodation provider at their sole discretion choose not to pre-authorize a damage deposit they retain the right to charge the credit card used at time of reservation with the actual amount of any costs relating to repair or cleaning to return the property to the original standard of the accommodation on your arrival. To the extent any credit or refund is due, such amount will be refunded to you in the original form of payment, at the sole discretion of the accommodation provider.</p>
<h5>Virtual Checkin Damage Waiver Terms of Service</h5>
<p>Where applicable, these terms of service govern the accidental damage waiver offered by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName). Virtual checkin where applicable offers you an ability to purchase a Damage Waiver to protect you against accidental damage that might occur while you occupy the Accommodation for the intended purpose as defined by the house rules and is governed by the Rental Agreement you have signed. This fee is taken in lieu of a larger refundable security deposit, and is non-refundable.</p>
<p>This fee offers you, as well as @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) protection against accidental damages, up to the allotted amount specified by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName).</p>
<p>Please note that the ability to purchase this Accidental Damage Protection plan is only possible at the time of verification, prior to receiving the check-in instructions from @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName). The payment for this fee must be completed using an approved credit card belonging to an individual participating in or associated with the reservation. This protection plan is offered for the purpose of simplifying the claim process and to reduce the total chargeable security deposit charged upon occupying the rented space as defined by the usage agreement by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName).</p>
<p>The Damage Waiver Fee Plan is designed to cover unintentional damages to the Accommodation interior, exterior and common spaces that occur during your stay. The policy will pay a maximum benefit of the allotted amount specified by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName). Any damages that exceed the allotted amount specified by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) will be charged to you directly. If during the stay at this Accommodation you, or those sharing the accommodation with you, cause any damage to real or personal effects of the Accommodation as a result of inadvertent acts or omissions, the Damage Waiver Fee Plan will reimburse @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) for the cost of repair or replacement of such effects up to a maximum benefit of the total amount specified by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName).</p>
<p>To ensure that you are not charged for any damages, you are responsible for reporting any accidental damages to @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) prior to leaving the rented space, or immediately upon identification of such damages.</p>
<p>Coverage under this plan is not provided for loss or damages due to:</p>
<ul role="list">
    <li>Intentional acts or gross negligence by you and/or your guests*</li>
    <li>Damage caused recklessly or wilfully and disregards the consequences to the Accommodation including loss or damage by animals or pets*</li>
    <li>Normal wear and tear of the real or personal property assigned to the Accommodation, inclusive of common spaces</li>
    <li>Any damage that occurs if you are in violation of the signed usage agreement*</li>
    <li>Loss, theft or damage to any personal effects of your own, either owned or brought by you*</li>
    <li>Loss, theft or damage caused by any person other than you or your traveling companions with whom you share the Accommodation reservation, inclusive of any approved additional daytime visitors to the Accommodation*</li>
    <li>Any cause, if you do not report the damage immediately to @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) and prior to checking out of the Accommodation*</li>
</ul>
<p>*In the event of loss or damage to the Accommodation caused by such acts or omissions by you and/or your invitee’s, you will be entirely liable for such damages. Any of the aforementioned issues or damages may be debited from the credit card on file as submitted by you or the individual associated with the reservation with @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName).</p>
<h5>Terms of Coverage</h5>
<p>The Accidental Damage Limited Waiver of Liability takes effect upon check-in to the Accommodation together with payment of the Waiver fee before check-in. The Waiver shall terminate upon normal checkout time or your departure, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>Waiver Fees Are Not Refundable</p>
<h5>Payment</h5>
<p>All reservations booked through @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) must be prepaid in full. You agree to pay to @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) the fees, costs, expenses and other charges in connection with your booking as per your Booking Confirmation, or which has been confirmed by a subsequent amendment to your Booking Confirmation, including all and any modifications. You acknowledge and agree that all amounts due will be billed to your payment card, or that you will pay the amounts due using another payment method approved by @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName).</p>
<h5>Bank and Credit Card Fees</h5>
<p>Many card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the &ldquo;merchant location&rdquo; (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard)) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee is determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholder&rsquo;s account. When applied by the card issuer, the fees will be listed separately from the transaction amount on a credit or debit card statement. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>
<h5>Travel / Medical Insurance</h5>
<p>We recommend that you obtain independent insurance to provide adequate cover for medical expenses, personal accident, loss of baggage and curtailment or cancellation of your trip. Please note that such insurance is not included with your purchase.</p>
<h5>Check-In</h5>
<p>The check-in time is specific to the accommodation you have chosen and is stated in the Arrival Instructions you receive with your Booking Confirmation. If you do not arrive on the date stated in your arrival instructions (&ldquo;arrival date&rdquo;) and you do not contact @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName), in advance and in writing, to state your intention to arrive after the specified arrival date, your booking will be canceled, the accommodation will not be available or accessible to you, and no refund for any part of your booking will be available.</p>
<h5>Check-Out</h5>
<p>The check-in time is specific to the accommodation you have chosen and is stated in the Arrival Instructions you receive with your Booking Confirmation. Unless you have an agreed late check-out as part of your Booking Confirmation, or which has been confirmed by a subsequent amendment to your Booking Confirmation, then you will be responsible for a charge equivalent to an additional one night of accommodation. If you overstay by more than 4 hours then the accommodation provider reserves the right to enter the property and remove your belongings and take such further action as may be necessary or appropriate, the costs of any such action will be charged against the credit card you provided at check-in.</p>
<h5>Safety and Conduct</h5>
<p>You have primary responsibility for your own safety and for the safety of anyone that you allow on to the property during your stay. You must read any fire or health &amp; safety guidance and listen to any instructions or explanations which are provided to you. It is your responsibility to bring any concerns regarding the accommodation to the attention of the check-in staff and to ask any questions that you may have if you do not understand any of the guidance or instructions provided.</p>
<p>If you become aware of anything during your stay which you believe is a health &amp; safety risk, you must inform the accommodation provider immediately. The accommodation provider will have access to the property at all times during your stay to address any such issues.</p>
<p>You may not allow any person other than the person named in the Booking Confirmation to occupy the accommodation at any time, except such number of additional guests as may be specified in the Booking Confirmation. This agreement is personal to you and may not be transferred to any other person. The accommodation provider will not allow any person other than the persons named in the Booking Confirmation to access or occupy the property.</p>
<p>The Booking Confirmation may specify the maximum permitted number of guests who are authorized to stay in the property. If you allow more than the maximum number of people to occupy or stay in the accommodation, you will be liable to pay a supplement of up to 100% of the nightly accommodation charge in respect of each unauthorized guest and the booking may be terminated immediately with no refund.</p>
<p>In addition to complying with all reasonable directions you also agree that you will:</p>
<ul role="list">
    <li>leave the accommodation in the same condition as you find it;</li>
    <li>keep the accommodation clean, tidy and clear of trash:</li>
    <li>not keep or take any pets or animals into the accommodation (unless otherwise agreed with us and specified as pet-friendly in the Booking Confirmation);</li>
    <li>not obstruct or leave any objects or waste in any common areas;</li>
    <li>not leave any obstruction outside of the accommodation;</li>
    <li>not do or permit to be done on the accommodation anything which is or which may be or become a nuisance, (whether actionable or not) damage, annoyance, inconvenience or disturbance to other guests or occupiers of the building or any owners or occupiers of neighbouring properties including (but not limited to) playing loud music or musical instruments, dancing, entertaining at the accommodation or moving furniture;</li>
    <li>not conduct any illegal activity from the accommodation;</li>
    <li>not bring any illegal drugs or firearms into the accommodation or onto the property;</li>

    <li>not make any alteration or addition whatsoever to the accommodation or its contents;</li>
    <li>not use the accommodation for any purpose other than for personal accommodation;</li>
    <li>You acknowledge that the accommodation is a home and you agree not to access any cupboard or drawers which have been sealed with tamper tape or locked. You may be subject to a charge for any breach of any tamper tape or damage to any locks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that you do not comply with these and all other reasonable directions you may forfeit all, or part of, your damage deposit and be asked to vacate the accommodation, without any refund due.</p>
<p>You hereby indemnify Jetstream, the accommodation provider, and the owner, in respect of any and all costs, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs suffered or incurred by the owner (or accommodation provider) or any of the foregoing parties arising out of or relating to a breach by you of this Agreement.</p>
<h5>Property Damage</h5>
<p>You must notify the accommodation provider of any damage to the property, contents, fixtures or fittings which occurs during your stay, even if you regard the damage as minimal or normal wear and tear or if you do not believe the damage is your fault.</p>
<p>If you do not notify the accommodation provider of any such damage you will be fully responsible for such damage on a full replacement cost basis.</p>
<p>If you do declare any damage, then you are responsible for full replacement cost.</p>
<p>You have authorized Jetstream and the accommodation provider to charge any property damage for which you are responsible to the credit card supplied by you.</p>
<h5>Liability and Claims</h5>
<p>Any claims made by you under the Terms &amp; Conditions of Service must be made initially through Jetstream.&nbsp; Jetstream has the authority to negotiate and settle claims between you and the accommodation provider. If you notify Jetstream within 14 days after making such a claim that, in your opinion, the dispute has not been satisfactorily resolved, then Jetstream is authorized to provide you with the accommodation providers details so that you may thereafter pursue the claim directly with the accommodation provider.</p>

<p>You agree that Jetstream, the accommodation provider, the owner, or any third party providing services on behalf of the accommodation provider or Jetstream, will not have any liability for any business, financial or economic loss or for any consequential, incidental, special or indirect losses such as lost reputation, lost bargain, lost profit, loss of anticipated savings or lost opportunity arising as a result of these Terms &amp; Conditions of Service, the accommodation or the booking (whether such loss arises as a result of negligence, breach of contract, tort or otherwise by the accommodation provider or any agent or third party providing services on behalf of the accommodation provider).</p>
<p>Nothing in this clause limits or excludes the liability of the accommodation provider for death or personal injury arising as a result of their gross negligence or willful misconduct or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of their agents or employees.</p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold the accommodation provider and Jetstream harmless from any and all liability, claims, loss, property damage or expenses arising by reason of any injury, death or damages sustained by any person, or to the property of any person, including you or any visitors or invitees whom you permit to enter the accommodation or the premises of which the accommodation is a part, where such injury death or damage is caused by your negligent or intentional act or omission, or by any such visitors or invitees.</p>
<p>If Jetstream or the accommodation provider is required to engage any attorney to enforce the conditions of these Terms &amp; Conditions of Service, to collect any amounts due, to remove you or your belongings from the accommodation, you shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs incurred in connection with the foregoing.</p>
<p>Subject to the limitations set out in these Terms &amp; Conditions of Service and to the extent permitted by law, we shall only be liable for direct damages actually suffered, paid or incurred by you due to an attributable shortcoming of our obligations in respect to our services, up to an aggregate amount of the aggregate cost of your reservation as set out in the Booking Confirmation (whether for one event or series of connected events).</p>

<h3 id="privacy-policy">3. Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Privacy is a very serious matter to Jetstream. We understand that booking online involves significant trust in us. We appreciate and value your trust and are committed to ensuring the security and confidentiality of your personal information. We never sell your personal information.</p>
<p>This document, which we update from time to time, describes how we use and process your personal information and how we use cookies and web beacons. It also tells you how you can contact us if you have questions about your personal information.</p>
<h5>What Kind of Info Do We Collect?</h5>
<p><strong>Reservation Data</strong></p>
<p>In order to process your reservation request, we must know basic information about you that can be used to identify you such as your full name, phone number, postal address, e-mail address, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). You may also choose to provide us with personal information about other members of your booking party. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the other party&rsquo;s permission to provide us with their personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Website Browsing Information</strong></p>
<p>We may automatically collect information about your computer when you visit our website. For example, we may collect your IP address and web browser software and information about your online activity, such as website pages viewed and reservations made. We use this automatic information to customize your user experience; to inhibit fraud; to serve advertisements, special offers and other information that may be of interest to you; and for other legitimate purposes we bring to your attention.</p>
<p>If you are using a mobile device, we might also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics and latitude/longitude details.</p>
<p>We may also receive information about you, including photographs, when you interact with us via social media services.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to collect or use this session information, you can access the accommodation we offer by booking with our Destination Experts by phone. Please call us on +1 505-448-8809 or email us at <a href="mailto:@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail">@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail</a>.</p>
<h5>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</h5>
<p>We collect and use personal information about you to help you find the right accommodation options; to assist you in making bookings and any subsequent modifications or updates you may request; and to provide travel notifications. We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the reservation requests you submit on our website.</p>
<p>We also use your information to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to troubleshoot any problems you may have with your booking, and to invite you to leave a review after your stay.</p>
<p>We may also use your information for marketing activities and for tailoring our products and services to suit your personal interests. For example we may email you to make it easy for you to take advantage of any special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you, and to send you regular newsletters. You will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these messages at the point of email collection and in any such email we send.</p>
<p>We may also use your information to contact you and ask for your help so that we may improve our products, service, and website.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may use your information to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use and to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<h5>Guest Submissions</h5>
<p>After your stay at any accommodation booked through us, you will be invited to submit a guest review, which may ask for information about the accommodation, the surrounding areas, and the destination. If you don&rsquo;t want to use your name with the review, you can make use of a screen name or it can be displayed online anonymously. By completing a guest review, you are agreeing that it can be displayed (as further described in our Terms and Conditions) on, for example, the relevant accommodation information page on our websites, in our mobile apps, in our social media accounts and, or on the website of the relevant accommodation or on our business partner&rsquo;s website, to inform other travelers about the quality and services at the accommodation you stayed in.</p>
<p>If you indicate that a guest review was helpful &ndash; or not helpful &ndash; we will aggregate this with feedback from other customers in order to sort and prioritise guest reviews. We may use the information in your shortlists or in other destination-related information you share with us in anonymous form to help other travelers to find the right destination.</p>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>We use cookies for server diagnostic and website administration and maintenance purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, to improve the site, to understand which areas of the site are used most often, to enhance your on-line experience, and to gather general demographic information. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Jetstream uses non-identifying cookies to provide easier site navigation and access to forms. Our cookies do not generate personal data, do not read personal data from your machine and are never tied to anything that could be used to identify you.</p>
<p>We are not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information not entered by visitors. Our site logs generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our sites. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.</p>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from this site, you will not be able to access portions of our site.</p>
<h5>Web Beacons</h5>
<p>Our website may also use Web beacons which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>
<p>If you do not want to accept cookies or Web beacons, you can access the accommodation we offer by booking with our Destination Experts by phone. Please call us on <a href="tel:@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactPhone)">@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactPhone)</a>. If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at <a href="mailto:@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail">@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail</a>.</p>
<h5>How do we use social media?</h5>
<p>We use social media to promote our accommodation providers&rsquo; properties and to promote, improve and facilitate our own services. So when you click on one of the buttons and register with your social media account, information is shared with your social media provider, and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing these buttons, Jetstream uses social media by maintaining accounts on several social media sites. These social media services may allow you to share information with us. The information you choose to share with us may include the basic information that&rsquo;s available in your social media profile, email address, status updates and your list of friends. This information is necessary to create a unique user experience.</p>
<h5>Mobile Devices</h5>
<p>We use versions of our regular website that have been optimised for mobile devices. These mobile websites process the personal details you give us in much the same way as our website.</p>
<h5>Who do we share your info with?</h5>
<p>We do not and will never sell your personal information. In certain circumstances, we may share your personal information with third parties as described in this Privacy Promise.</p>
<p>We will share your information with our accommodation providers who fulfill your reservation requests. By sending us a reservation request you are authorizing us to disclose to our suppliers the information required to complete the booking. These suppliers are not controlled by Jetstream and personal information disclosed to them is subject to their applicable privacy policies and security practices. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any accommodation provider whose product you purchase through this site. Please note that these accommodation providers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your reservation, or respond to a review you may submit.</p>
<p>We will also share your information with third-parties who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, marketing, distribution of surveys, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or, as discussed below, to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies and governments around the world for security, customs and immigration purposes. Such requirements may be in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. Also, when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website, our guests, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.</p>
<p>Your information may also be shared in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.</p>
<p>We may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>
<p>As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any information, although it may be needed to book accommodation. You also can add or update information at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail">@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail</a> or calling us on <a href="tel:@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactPhone)">@(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactPhone)</a>.</p>
<h5>Security Procedures to Safeguard Personal Information</h5>
<p>We want you to feel confident about using this website to make reservation requests, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. We have implemented appropriate business procedures, including security, technical, and physical restrictions to help protect the personal information you provide to us. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. However, please note that no electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. For additional details about the security measures we have implemented to safeguard personal information, please see our Jetstream Security Protocols.</p>
<h5>Children</h5>
<p>At @(ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.LegalEntityName) we do not direct our website nor offer services to children. When we receive information from someone we believe to be under 18 years of age we contact that individual only to let them know that our service is unavailable to them and promptly delete any personal information that the individual has provided to us.</p>
<h5>Data Storage Outside of Canada</h5>
<p>Please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated, as well as other countries. The data protection and other laws of the United States and these other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.</p>
<h5>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the email address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our website.</p>
<h5>How You Can Contact Us</h5>

You can request an overview of your personal data by emailing us at <a href="mailto:@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail">@ResourcesMicroSiteSpecific.PrimaryContactEmail</a>. Please write &lsquo;Request personal information&rsquo; in the subject line of your email and include a copy of your identity card to help us prevent unauthorised individuals from accessing your personal data.</p>
